# flashcard_generator

Contains two Python scripts: one to create Anki flashcards from a poem, another to create Anki flashcards from a sequence.
See the comments at the top of either program for more information (synopsis of program, how to format input, guidance on usage).

Credit to https://github.com/eudoxia0/spaced-repetition-tools for the idea; but needed a very different implementation to create flashcards suitable for Anki (rather than Mochi); and to https://github.com/quentinsf/poem2anki/blob/master/poem2anki.py, which inspired some of the implementation of my Poetry script. Leveraged Bing AI to aid code-writing.
